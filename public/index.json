For the 2024–25 season, I led the design of a worm-gear-driven mechanical claw optimized for strength, precision, and manufacturability that integrated into our very own 5 DOF arm. For the current 2025-2026 season, I\u0026rsquo;m an arm design lead and I\u0026rsquo;m currently leading a subteam of 8 members with the united goal of producing a highly functional 5 DOF robotic arm.\nDesign # The claw was born in SolidWorks, evolving from napkin sketches into a three-pound end-effector printed in PLA and powered by a high-torque hobby servo. Its defining feature is a worm gear drive — a compact system that converts rotary motion into the claw\u0026rsquo;s distinct self-locking grasp. Each claw finger is mounted on shafted bearings for low-friction motion, with rubber pads added to increase grip on irregular objects. A mounted camera provides visual feedback for target detection, alignment, and optimized control.\nWe needed something strong enough to lift 2–3 lb payloads, precise enough to handle sample tubes, and light enough to stay within our arm torque budget. To achieve that, I tuned gear ratios to triple output torque while keeping total rotation under 90°, ensuring predictable, stable motion during pickup tasks.\nPrototyping \u0026amp; Testing # The first prototype was completed in December 2024 after just six weeks of CAD modeling, vendor ordering, and 3D printing. Testing showed strong compliance under load, with grasping torque exceeding 0.6 N·m and repeatable control via Arduino-based servo commands. With the worm gear only transmitting torque in one direction, it confirmed the claws non-backdrivability — meaning it could hold objects even when powered off.\nBy January 2025, a second-generation revision with optimized structural components, formalized shafts with snapper ring grooves, new bearing retainment plates, and an entirely redesigned claw finger led to much improved performance.\nLessons \u0026amp; Next Steps # Through this build, I learned a ton of things.\nOne key learning was working on a team with a relatively low budget. Sometimes, it was difficult to afford components and I had to work and adapt to the components the team already had in supply. That meant being incredibly flexible and prototyping a lot with the options available. This also confirmed how seemingly small design choices — gear alignment, wall thickness, and print orientation — directly impact torque transmission and durability.\nLooking forward to this upcoming year, the current claw under construction will:\nReduce mass by ~25% using lighter materials and reducing motor sizing to generate more RPM (and less torque) Explore more compliant finger geometries for adaptive grasping. Integrate a modular quick-mount for easier servicing Reflection # Designing the claw taught me how to balance mechanical simplicity with functional reliability.\nIt’s a system that translates pure geometry and physics into controlled, purposeful movement — something that captures exactly what drew me to robotics in the first place.\n","date":"1 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/projects/rover-claw/","section":"Projects","summary":"Designing a durable, high-torque claw for the WashU Mars Rover Team’s 2024–25 University Rover Challenge entry","title":"Mars Rover Robotics: End Effector Design","type":"projects"},{"content":"Below are a few of the projects I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on complete with descriptions \u0026amp; pictures\n","date":"1 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":" Background # The MeshAlyzer™ was developed by a senior design team in Dr. Spencer Lake’s Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Lab at WashU to address a major gap in hernia mesh evaluation.\nEvery year, nearly 1 million hernia repairs are performed in the U.S., and yet up to 13% result in recurrence due to improper mesh selection or failure under physiological conditions. Most tests rely on static loading — but real abdominal walls experience cyclical pressure surges from breathing, coughing, or movement.\nThe MeshAlyzer was engineered to simulate these realistic, dynamic intra-abdominal pressures, giving researchers a way to quantify how different meshes distribute stress and strain on tissue — a critical factor in surgical outcomes.\nSystem Overview # At its core, the MeshAlyzer uses a polyurethane balloon system capable of generating 110.8 kPa of pressure (equivalent to a human cough) in under 0.5 seconds. The balloon sits beneath tissue samples held in custom-machined aluminum clamps that stretch tissue by 10% while maintaining physiological tension.\nA machine learning–calibrated transducer network ensures 99% pressure accuracy, while a Raspberry Pi interface and intuitive Python GUI allow for real-time monitoring, calibration, and automation.\nThe design prioritizes both safety (IPX4 housing, emergency shutoff, pressure relief valves) and usability, validated through user testing in Lake Lab that rated the interface ≥ 4.5 / 5 for clarity and ease of use.\nMy Contributions # While the MeshAlyzer was primarily developed by the senior design team, my work focused on improving the system’s mechanical and sensing performance — refining the way the device behaves under load and improving experimental reproducibility.\nKey Modifications I Made: # Balloon Integrity and Pressure Optimization — Reanalyzed the balloon’s flow-rate characteristics and supply pressure curve, verifying that ~700 kPa inlet pressure achieved the 110.8 kPa target within 0.5 s without rupture. Clamp Redesign — Adjusted lead screw alignment and mounting tolerances to improve symmetric tensioning and reduce motor strain during long-duration tests. Sensor Noise Reduction — Implemented revised pressure calibration routines to minimize drift, combining neural network smoothing with low-pass signal filtering. Thermal Control Integration — Designed an improved heating-pad mount beneath the tissue frame to maintain 38.7 °C, matching physiological temperature for future biological testing. User Interface Refinement — Added clearer pressure feedback and system status indicators to the Python-based GUI, improving test repeatability and usability. These changes collectively enhanced data stability, safety, and test accuracy, laying groundwork for future iterations of the device that could integrate 3D deformation tracking and automated pressure profiling.\nResults \u0026amp; Learnings # Through this project, I learned to navigate the intersection of mechanical design and biomedical testing — where precision, ethics, and safety converge.\nThe MeshAlyzer demonstrated the ability to simulate realistic cough-level pressures, maintain tissue stretch over hours, and offer repeatable, quantifiable data for mesh evaluation.\nWhile challenges like sensor drift and limited biological validation remain, the device represents a significant step toward data-driven mesh selection in hernia repair and sets a foundation for ongoing translational research.\nReflection # Contributing to the MeshAlyzer taught me the value of iterative design in a biomedical context — how subtle adjustments in geometry, pressure control, and data interpretation can transform experimental reliability. It also deepened my understanding of soft tissue biomechanics and medical device verification, shaping the way I now approach engineering for healthcare impact.\n","date":"15 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/projects/meshalyzer/","section":"Projects","summary":"A biomedical testing device designed to simulate realistic intra-abdominal pressures for evaluating surgical hernia meshes.","title":"MeshAlyzer: Dynamic Hernia Mesh Testing Platform","type":"projects"},{"content":" The Story # Fulfil Solutions, a company based in the Bay Area I worked at over the summer, is committed to building automated grocery fulfillment systems. They integrate mobile robots, dense storage trays, and computer vision to pick, pack, and deliver items across all temperature zones—aiming for high accuracy and sharply reduced labor costs.\nWhen I joined Fulfil, the team was working through a significant design challenge: keeping grocery bags open during high-speed automated packing.\nFulfil’s robots handle thousands of totes per hour, each carrying multiple open bags held in place by clips. Clips are needed to secure the bag and maintain enough tension to keep it open, but with too much tension, tearing is also a concern. It was a deceptively simple problem that required a lot of analysis and a deep dive into compliance mechanics.\nUnderstanding the Problem # The existing clips that proved to be an issue were incredibly rigid. Their design didn\u0026rsquo;t account for the degrees of tolerance at play or the variation in bag placement. That meant a clip that was perfect on one assembly might over-compress or under-tension on another.\nMy goal was to redesign the clip to tolerate that variance without sacrificing consistency or manufacturability.\nThrough some initial testing and background work, a few targets were set at the start:\nTension range: 2–6 N (enough to hold the bag open, but not tear it) Deflection range: 5–8 mm under load Yield safety factor: ≥ 1.5 under maximum deflection Cycle life: 1M+ operations Design Exploration # I started by modeling the existing geometry and overlaying the worst-case dimensional stack-up from CAD. Generating a spreadsheet of all the GD\u0026amp;T informed dimensions and combining that into an overall tolerance stackup made the amount of spring range much clearer. Using both Excel-based tolerance simulations and SolidWorks interference checks, I quantified the maximum allowable clip deflection.\nFrom there, I compared three design families:\nConical compression springs — simple, but hard to control force linearly. Torsion springs — compact, but difficult to package cleanly around the tote wall. Flat spring mechanisms — manufacturable, tunable, and ideal for high-cycle flexure. I ran quick analytical models for each, calculating stress, deflection, and strain energy. After verifying their effectiveness, I designed 3D-printable prototypes and ordered variations of all three spring types from COTS providers. After receiving all the springs and assembling them, it was time for some initial testing.\nTesting and Iteration # The first prototype immediately showed improvement: consistent retention and no bag tearing.\nBut under dynamic loads, the clips bottomed out just before full tote engagement — meaning our preload was too high.\nUpdating my constraints and iterating on my prototype, I eventually developed a finalized prototype that accomplished the goals set out at the start. It was designed for a 3D printed clip, but the compliant component would be a hardened 17-7PH CH900 steel flat spring. Ultimately, it was time to think about designing for production.\nManufacturing and Integration # In order to move to a production version, I ironed out a few details:\nRan an FEA on the prototype and verified fatigue life through S-N analysis Spec’d the material as 17-7PH CH900, laser-cut, bent, and heat-treated for fatigue strength Optimized bend radii to minimize stress risers and maintain repeatable springback Reduced per-unit clip cost by 38% Ensured the clip cover could be injection molded while the clip itself could be milled Presented my final production process \u0026amp; final design to R\u0026amp;D design team Reflections # I learned a ton throughout this project. I learned that tiny compliance errors can cascade into major system issues. A few tenths of a millimeter in a stack-up could mean the difference between smooth automation and a jammed line. *I learned to trust a process that moves fluidly between analysis, physical prototyping, and iterative testing — and how to balance elegant design with rugged reliability. In the end, we turned a fragile, temperamental mechanism into a robust, production-ready spring system that works across every tote, every cycle, and is implementable in every one of Fulfil\u0026rsquo;s automation facilities.\nKey Outcomes\nReduced tolerance-induced failure rate by \u0026gt;75% Extended clip life beyond 120k cycles without fatigue failure Lowered material cost by 38% Maintained consistent bag tension within ±0.3 N ","date":"14 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/projects/compliance-mechanism/","section":"Projects","summary":"Improving bag retention reliability in automated grocery systems through compliant spring design and tolerance optimization.","title":"Fulfil Solutions: Tote Clip Compliance","type":"projects"},{"content":" Background # The Circuit Car project was a small-scale autonomous system that combined mechanical design, embedded programming, and circuit integration into a single platform.\nThe goal was to create a Bluetooth-controlled vehicle capable of both manual steering and autonomous obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. Built around an Arduino Uno, the car featured dual DC motors, a motor driver shield, a Bluetooth module, and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor.\nThe system was designed to be modular, low-cost, and adaptable—allowing real-time remote control from a smartphone app while supporting onboard logic for autonomous response. Although the foundation was solid, the path to a working prototype involved multiple iterations, debugging sessions, and careful tuning of both hardware and code.\nDevelopment Process # We began by developing the base control structure: PWM-driven motor speed control combined with Bluetooth serial commands. Early tests exposed a variety of issues—from electrical interference and faulty ports to incorrect timing functions in sensor readings. Rather than redesigning the whole circuit, we approached each failure as an opportunity to better understand how software and hardware interact at the micro level.\nKey challenges and their solutions:\nIssue Solution Mechanical delays, blocked USB ports, missing hardware Replaced motor shield, sourced screws, and 3D printed chassis for free on campus Serial.read() outputting corrupted data Switched to BT.read() for stable Bluetooth communication Limited motor control flexibility Implemented the Adafruit motor control library Bluetooth communication indexing errors Wrote code to skip erroneous or repeated command inputs Excessive battery drain Replaced batteries with high-efficiency cells and reduced total vehicle weight Motor control inconsistency due to poor pin mapping Re-soldered connections to align with proper PWM output pins Unreliable ultrasonic timing Replaced delay() with micros() for accurate timing control Dysfunctional motor shield ports Wired motors in parallel to functional outputs Results and Learnings # After iterative refinement, the car successfully responded to real-time Bluetooth commands and navigated around obstacles autonomously with smooth PWM transitions. Latency was reduced to under 0.3 seconds, and obstacle detection was accurate up to 120 cm, even under varying light conditions.\nBeyond the technical results, the process taught me the importance of debugging systematically—isolating one subsystem at a time rather than treating failures as whole-system flaws.\nI also learned how small inefficiencies in wiring and code structure can have significant effects on system responsiveness and energy usage.\nReflection # The Circuit Car project was more than an exercise in electronics—it was a hands-on exploration of electromechanical design. Each iteration reinforced a habit of structured troubleshooting and showed how even small embedded systems benefit from modularity, documentation, and adaptability.\n","date":"5 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/projects/arduino-car/","section":"Projects","summary":"Designing and refining a microcontroller-based vehicle with Bluetooth control, ultrasonic sensing, and custom motor circuitry.","title":"Circuit Car: Bluetooth-Controlled Autonomous Vehicle","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"25 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"25 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/tags/compliance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Compliance","type":"tags"},{"content":"Compact worm-gear drive with compliant fingertips for irregular objects.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been really interested in the robotics and product design space for a while so definitely go take a look at some of my projects I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on in the past few years. Deeper descriptions of the work and technical details of each project can be found in the other tab, but here\u0026rsquo;s more about my story and my path to where I am now.\nMy passion for building \u0026amp; designing things originated when I was really little and fascinated by trains, cars, and Legos. When I reached high school, I joined my FRC robotics team where I got tons of exposure to the world of electromechanical design. I contributed in a ton of different ways when we won the world championship in 2022 and ultimately got to lead design and integration of an extremely efficient horizontal scoring mechanism in 2023 as the technical director.\nOnce I got to college, I was desperate to get involved in a ton of different activities. I joined the WashU Robotics team as a part of the Mars Rover Arm Design subteam in 2024. Specializing in claw design, I worked hard to implement a functional claw as well as manage overall 5 DOF arm design as I ultimately became the subteam lead this year. I also joined the Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Lab on the hernia box project. I\u0026rsquo;m working on building a biomedical robotic platform called the MeshAlyzer to perform tests on abdominal tissue and measure strain under realistic breathing/coughing conditions.\nLast summer, I got the opportunity to work at Fulfil Solutions - a grocery automation startup in the Bay Area. I was tasked with designing, testing, and ultimately producing a compliant spring mechanism for properly securing grocery bags into their line-following robots. Outside of school, I also love working through projects whether that\u0026rsquo;s using my Arduino skills to make mini RC cars or my quick prototyping skills to make a room gadget.\nI love the creative process behind engineering - especially the part where a rough sketch becomes a working prototype. My favorite work is hands-on whether that\u0026rsquo;s designing parts that can be machined, integrating sensors and control loops, and refining details until the final system feels perfect.\nOutside of work and academics, I also have a lot of other hobbies.\nMY HOBBIES # South Asian Culture # I\u0026rsquo;m really passionate about my South Asian culture and I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot to get involved at WashU. As a social chair for WashU ASHOKA and a member of WashU Bhangra (WUBB), I\u0026rsquo;ve immersed myself in south asian culture at WashU.\nFood # I absolutely love food whether\nSports # I love sports.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/about/","section":"About Me","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"about"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PersonalPortfolio/categories/student-team/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Student Team","type":"categories"}]
