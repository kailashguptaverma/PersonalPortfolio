## Building Champions: 2022–2023

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is one of the world’s most competitive STEM programs, where high school teams design and build 125+ lb robots in just six weeks to play a new game each year. With thousands of teams competing worldwide, it's really tough to set your team apart. When I was a part of Team 254 at my high school Bellarmine College Prep, our team, The Cheesy Poofs, had a ton of success.

### 2022 — SIDEWAYS

The 2022 season, Rapid React, marked our full return to in-person competition. Our robot, Sideways, was built around speed and consistency — featuring Team 254’s first-ever swerve drive and a climber capable of reaching the highest, traversal bar in under 10 seconds.

I worked extensively on assembly, electrical wiring, and subteam coordination, ensuring clean integration between Falcon motors, color sensors, pneumatics, and control systems. During the final stretch, I helped lead testing and troubleshooting across systems — shooter calibration, autonomous tuning, and climber sequencing — helping Sidways perform flawlessly through regionals and the 2022 Houston World Championship, where we finished as World Champions.

### 2023 — Breakdown & Laterator Design

In 2023’s Charged Up, our robot Breakdown pushed mechanical precision to new heights. The game required fast scoring across multiple heights and depths, leading me to design an entirely new mechanism: the laterator, short for lateral elevator.  

The laterator was a three-stage, angled elevator system built from carbon-fiber tubing with custom endcaps for maximum stiffness and minimal weight. Its angled geometry allowed Breakdown to drive straight into the substation wall and acquire or score game pieces in one smooth motion — the physical embodiment of our “touch it, own it” philosophy.

Unlike traditional vertical elevators, the laterator used cascade rigging, meaning all stages extended simultaneously for faster, more controlled motion. The system was reinforced with crossbars, A-frames, and stiffening plates to resist torsion under heavy load and repeated impacts. Mid-season testing revealed bending in earlier aluminum frame rails, which led us to upgrade to solid aluminum front rails and layered steel–aluminum “Oreo” belly pans, improving durability and lowering the robot’s center of gravity.

I worked heavily on the mechanical design, assembly, and integration of the laterator. My contributions included refining rigging tension, chain paths, and stage geometry to reduce binding, routing electrical and pneumatic lines cleanly through the moving stages, and supporting climb calibration and zeroing to ensure consistent operation. The laterator’s carbon-fiber construction and angled profile made it both lightweight and incredibly strong, delivering rapid, stable motion throughout matches.

Combined with its claw intake, compact drivebase, and tuned autonomous routines, Breakdown became one of the most mechanically refined robots 254 had ever built — fast, durable, and relentlessly consistent. Its performance carried us through regional wins and though we didn't finish at the top like 2022, our robot was incredibly successful and a great piece of combined teamwork and engineering.

### Reflection

Across both seasons, my role evolved from wiring and integration to mechanical design ownership and system leadership.  

From SIDEWAYS’ electrical and control systems to BREAKDOWN’s laterator and structure, I learned how small mechanical details — a properly tensioned chain, a reinforced joint, or a precisely machined spacer — can define reliability at the highest level of competition.
