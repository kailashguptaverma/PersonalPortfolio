## MY STORY

I'm a junior studying mechanical engineering and computer science at WashU in St. Louis. I've been really interested in the robotics and product design space for a while so definitely go take a look at some of my projects I've worked on in the past few years. Deeper descriptions of the work and technical details of each project can be found in the other tab, but here's more about my story and my path to where I am now.

My passion for building & designing things originated when I was really little and fascinated by trains, cars, and Legos. When I reached high school, I joined my FRC robotics team where I got tons of exposure to the world of electromechanical design. I contributed in a ton of different ways when we <a href="/PersonalPortfolio/projects/frc-world-champs/">won the world championship in 2022</a> and ultimately got to <a href="/PersonalPortfolio/projects/laterator-frc2023/">lead design and integration of an extremely efficient horizontal scoring mechanism</a> in 2023 as the technical director.

Once I got to college, I was desperate to get involved in a ton of different activities. I joined the WashU Robotics team as a part of the Mars Rover Arm Design subteam in 2024. Specializing in <a href="/PersonalPortfolio/projects/rover-claw">claw design</a>, I worked hard to implement a functional claw as well as manage overall 5 DOF arm design as I ultimately became the subteam lead this year. I also joined the Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Lab on the hernia box project. I'm working on building a biomedical robotic platform called the MeshAlyzer to perform tests on abdominal tissue and measure strain under realistic breathing/coughing conditions.

Last summer, I got the opportunity to work at Fulfil Solutions - a grocery automation startup in the Bay Area. I was tasked with designing, testing, and ultimately producing a compliant spring mechanism for properly securing grocery bags into their line-following robots. Outside of school, I also love working through projects whether that's using my Arduino skills to make mini RC cars or my quick prototyping skills to make a room gadget.

I love the creative process behind engineering - especially the part where a rough sketch becomes a working prototype. My favorite work is hands-on whether that's designing parts that can be machined, integrating sensors and control loops, and refining details until the final system feels perfect.

Outside of work and academics, I also have a lot of other hobbies.

## MY HOBBIES

### South Asian Culture

I'm really passionate about my South Asian culture and I've done a lot to get involved at WashU. As a social chair for WashU ASHOKA and a member of WashU Bhangra (WUBB), I've immersed myself in south asian culture at WashU.
